        profile: "Hey! I'm Saihaj. I'm a front end developer currently attending BCIT's Digital Design and Development program. In addition to my development and design experience, I've worked in several fast-paced retail environments with a focus on excellent service, communication, and teamwork. When I'm not coding I enjoy spending time outdoors, collecting watches, collecting records, and film photography. ",
        skill_desc: "I'm experienced in a variety of front end development skills and tools such as React/Next.JS and React Native. I've developed both web apps and mobile apps with a mulititude of different workflows. To supplement to my development knowledge, I'm also an experienced UX/UI Designer. To round out my skillset, I'm familiar and comfortable using the Adobe suite.",
        ideation: "Our goal with this project was to develop an application that could be beneficial to our community in a meaningful way. Based on this idea, we developed the idea for Frefurnish, a cross-platfrom mobile app designed for users to donate good, usable items they don’t wish to have anymore to the people that most need them. \n\n Our app had a particular focus on users donating furniture to indivudals working in social homes. We discovered through both primary and secondary research that furniture is prone to destruction in social homes, therefore having a single marketplace with only free items would be a big help.",
        prototyping: "Once we had our idea for the app mostly flushed out, we began working on the intial prototypes of the app. To create this app, we had to both design the UX and UI, as well as develop the application.\n\nWe began prototyping with rapid prototypes from each member of our team of 6. After a couple rounds of prototyping, we deliberated on which ideas we liked best and decieded on a final design for V1 of our application. \n\nFrom this point forward our design underwent multiple rounds of user testing to iron out kinks in the design and flow of the application. Each round of testing was followed by an updated version of the prototype with improvements suggested by the feedback received. \n\nFinally, after the high fidelity prototype was at a point where the testing wasn’t resulting in large scale changes, we began coding the application.",
        development: "Development of the app was a massive learning experience for me personally and I personally grew my skillset extensively during the dev cycle. I was the Lead Developer for the app and provided vision, support, and leadership to our team during the long and sometimes arduous process. \n\nFrefurnish was developed using React Native to ensure it was cross-platform from the very beginning. For the backend, we utilized a combination of Firebase and a MySQL database to handle authentication and storing data respectively. \n\nOur workflow began with a large planning process and understanding where components and functions could be re-used to maximize efficiency. From there, I delegated tasks to the team and myself and we proceeded to write the front-end and back-end of the app."
